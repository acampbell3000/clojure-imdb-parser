### Usage

First download the latest release jar:

	https://github.com/acampbell3000/clojure-imdb-parser/tree/master/release

If it's easier you can clone the whole project using git:

	git clone https://github.com/acampbell3000/clojure-imdb-parser

Once complete the release jars are standalone and can be executed on the
command line as follows:

	java -jar clojure-imdb-parser-[SOME VERSION]-standalone.jar
		"Film Title" "/path/to/output-file.txt"

As this can be a little cumbersome we also have a python script
which wraps the execution of the latest jar.

The python script can be found here:

	https://github.com/acampbell3000/clojure-imdb-parser/blob/master/run.py

The python script expects the latest release jar to be in the same directory
or ./release. In addition, it currently expects the operating system to
be a unix / linux based machine:

	./run.py -q "Film Title" -o "/path/to/output-file.txt"

Finally, please look at the CHANGES.txt file to see update
descriptions since the last release tag.
